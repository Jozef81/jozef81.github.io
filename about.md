This static web page is created using the [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) generator. The basic layout is based on the theme [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), which I modified for my needs. The style of the page is modified by CSS files based on the *Minima* theme. Part of the CSS files are taken from [Alfred G. Fischer](http://a-g-f.github.com/metro-ui-jekyll/), which are also slightly modified for the needs of a consistent look.

Used images taken from [PSDgraphics](http://www.psdgraphics.com)
